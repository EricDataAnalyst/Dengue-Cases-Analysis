# Dengue Cases and Death Analysis in the Philippines (2016 - 2020)
### Project Overview
This project presents a data-driven analysis of dengue cases and related deaths in the Philippines over five years (2016 - 2020). The dashboard is designed to visualize trends, regional distributions, and key metrics related to dengue outbreaks.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the dengue situation in the Philippines, helping policymakers and health organizations make informed decisions to combat the disease. The declining death rate suggests that while dengue remains a public health issue, interventions have improved survival rates.

#### About Dataset
Data set contains the recorded number of dengue cases per region of the Philippines from 2016 to 2020. It can be used to find trends about the disease as well as spatiotemporal analysis that can result in data-driven solutions about the trends of the disease for the past 5 years

#### MetaData
- Month - Month of the year in text format. <br>
- Year - Ranges from 2016-2020 in numerical format. <br>
- Region - Region in the Philippines. <br>
- Dengue_Cases - Number of Monthly Cases per region. The dengue deaths is also included in this feature. <br>
- Dengue_Deaths - Number of Monthly Deaths per region due to dengue.

#### Acknowledgements
Publisher would like to thank the Department of Health of the Philippines for making the data open to access to everyone.

### Sample Questions
- In what specific month do we observe the highest dengue cases? <br>
- What region has the highest average number of cases for the year 2016-2020? <br>
- What is the trend of the disease for the past 5 years? Is it going lower or higher? <br>
- What is the ratio of dengue deaths per dengue cases? Is it going lower or higher as time goes by?

### Objectives
- Analyze and visualize dengue cases and deaths across different years. <br>
- Identify regions with the highest dengue cases. <br>
- Highlight trends in dengue cases and death rates over time. <br>
- Provide key insights into dengue mortality rates.

### Key Insights
#### Increasing Dengue Cases:
- The overall trend of dengue cases is increasing, indicating a growing public health concern.
#### Decreasing Dengue Deaths:
- Despite the increase in cases, dengue-related deaths show a declining trend, suggesting improvements in medical response and disease management.
#### Regional Distribution:
- Region 4-A reports the highest average dengue cases from 2016 to 2020.
#### Death Case Ratio:
- The average death-to-case ratio for the five years is 4.01%, with year-wise variations.
#### Monthly Breakdown:
- The data includes a detailed monthly report showing dengue cases, deaths, and death case ratios.
